## Project Objective

Object detection System to identify age, emotion, ethnicity, and gender on human faces



## Tasks

1. In [Model Training](https://github.com/Yicheng-ZHANG/COMP90055_HappyPeople/tree/main/Model%20Training)

- Data transformation from the [**Real-world Affective Faces Database**](http://www.whdeng.cn/raf/model1.html) into COCO and VOC format
- Train models in open-sourced [**SSD**](https://github.com/bubbliiiing/ssd-pytorch), [**Faster RCNN**](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), [**YOLOv5**](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v5.0) frameworks, using Pytorch
- Our [**trained models**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tApOSxJigiSoclxau9_nBXM2P1DXP6Kl?usp=sharing) used in the applications are available.   

2. In [Backend](https://github.com/Yicheng-ZHANG/COMP90055_HappyPeople/tree/main/Backend) - API

- Deploy trained models on server, using Flask, Docker, and MRC

3. In [Mobile Application](https://github.com/Yicheng-ZHANG/COMP90055_HappyPeople/tree/main/Mobile%20Application)

- Develop mobile application in iOS and Android platform, using Swift and Java - [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/_GdX4mrPM7E)

4. Result Analysis

- Report result comparison between frameworks - [**Precentation Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_0dr-IViAweStPhS6tD02feLGEeLS-H/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118217110244173882486&rtpof=true&sd=true) & [**Report**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QyHq-QlF9SrpQ2Jylp6m5HA1519cltQ/view?usp=sharing)
